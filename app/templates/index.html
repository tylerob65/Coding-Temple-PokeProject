<h3>Welcome to PokeStop!</h3>
<p>PokeStop is for Pokemon Trainers!</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
        Trainers create rosters of 5 Pokemon, that they can then use to battle other trainers. Head on over to your profile
        page. That is where you can see your current roster. You can remove Pokemon from your roster, and then go on over to
        PokeSearch to add any Pokemon you want. The world is your cloyster!
        <br>
        <em> the catch… </em>
        <br>
        The total PokeScore of your roster can’t be over {{PokeScore_max}}!
</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Every Pokemon has been assigned a PokeScore based on their stats. Your total team PokeScore is the sum of the PokeScore
of every Pokemon on your roster. This makes it so that you can’t just put legendaries on your roster, and instead need to pick
and chose a good balance of Pokemon based on their stats and their types. Once you have 5 Pokemon on your roster with a
total PokeScore at {{PokeScore_max}} or below, you are then ready to battle!</p>
<h3>How Battles Work</h3>
<p>When the trainer you challenge accepts your battle challenge, or when you accept the battle challenge of another
training, the battle begins! Your Pokemon and their Pokemon are randomly paired up. Each Pokemon pair will battle it out
in their own round. You win the overall battle if your Pokemon win more rounds then your opponent’s Pokemon</p>
<h3>How Battle Rounds Work</h3>
<p>Each round consists of two Pokemon facing off. The Pokemon with the higher speed attacks first. The damage done by the
attack is based on the Attack stat of the attacker, the defense stat of the defender, and it stems from the damage
calculation used in <a class="poke_link" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damage#Generation_V_onward">Pokemon Generation V and onward</a>. The damage done 
also  <a class="poke_link" href="https://pokemondb.net/type">takes into account the types</a>  (i.e fire, water,
etc) of the two Pokemon. The damage done subtracts for the HP of the defending Pokemon. After being attacked, the
defender then takes a turn attacking. The Pokemon continue to take turns until one runs out of health and faints. The
last Pokemon standing wins the round!
